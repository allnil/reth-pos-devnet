# Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Devnet using Reth client

This repository provides a docker-compose file to run a fully-functional, local development network for Ethereum with proof-of-stake enabled.
It's a fork of https://github.com/OffchainLabs/eth-pos-devnet which uses Geth and our setup uses Reth https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth (Modular, contributor-friendly and blazing-fast :))
Consensus configs should be the same and you are welcome to follow Prysmatic guides: https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/advanced/proof-of-stake-devnet 

Thanks for Prysm team and OffchainLabs for all work they've made.
